/// keeps, or the copy the package manager took of it — and hands them back to the
/// next instance under the directory [DshLocalPlugins] owns, where they are a local
/// installation like any other.
///
/// A plugin installed from a **directory** is the one that does not travel. That is
/// somebody working on it, and the profile points at their directory rather than
/// holding a copy of it, so there is nothing here that belongs to the instance. The
/// export leaves such a plugin out and says so; see [DshPackForge] for the pack the
/// community's tooling reads, which cannot express it at all.
///
/// A plugin that the registry publishes at the version the instance has is *not*
/// carried: naming `name@version` installs the same thing from the registry, which
/// is smaller and is what a pack should do when it can. Deciding that is the
/// exporter's job — see [DshPackageRegistry#availability] — and what is left for
/// this class is the other case, where the files exist nowhere but here.
