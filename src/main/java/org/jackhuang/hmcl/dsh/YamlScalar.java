/// Writing a value into YAML that somebody else's parser will read back unchanged.
///
/// Every value this launcher writes into a harness settings file comes from a person or a vendor —
/// a vendor id, a model id, a name — so none of them may be assumed to be a harmless word. A plain
/// YAML scalar is a much smaller language than it looks:
///
/// - `model: qwen3:32b` is **not** a scalar with a colon in it. A colon inside a plain scalar must
///   not be followed by a space, and several parsers reject the line outright rather than guess;
///   the harness's own parser reports the document as malformed, and its settings layer then fails
///   on *every* later write. A model id with a colon is an ordinary thing to have.
/// - `model: a#b` is read as the scalar `a` with a comment after it: the rest is **silently
///   dropped**, so the harness would be pointed at a different model than the one asked for.
/// - `model: yes`, `model: "123"`, `model: null` are the booleans and numbers and null of YAML's
///   own vocabulary, not strings. Quoting is the only way to say "this is text".
///
/// So a value is quoted unless it is provably one of the few shapes that cannot be misread. Quoting
/// something that did not need it costs nothing; failing to quote something that did costs a
/// corrupted settings file.
