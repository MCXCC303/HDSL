/// Command-line arguments somebody typed for an instance, split into the two places they belong.

/// DeepSeek Harness takes its arguments in two groups, and a launcher has to keep them apart:
///
/// ```
/// dsh [launcher flags] --profile <name> [app flags] [app args]
/// ```
///
/// The launcher's own flags select and patch the profile tree, and the rest go to the booted app.
/// A single text box cannot say which is which, so this decides by the flag: the ones the launcher
/// owns come first, everything else follows the profile. That is what makes a line like
///
/// ```
/// --profile rescue --from-default-profile web --no-open
/// ```
///
/// work — `--profile` and `--from-default-profile` are the launcher's, `--from-default-profile web`
/// has to stay in that order, and `--no-open` belongs to the web app.
///
/// Two things are not the user's to set, and are reported rather than silently dropped:
///
/// - **`DSH_HOME`**, because it is how the launcher keeps one instance's state away from another's.
///   It is not a flag at all — it is an environment variable — but a line imitating one
///   (`DSH_HOME=/somewhere`) is refused for the same reason.
/// - **`--port`**, because the port is part of an instance's identity: the browser interface keys
///   its stored state by origin, so a port that moved would present an empty interface and two
///   writers could corrupt one history. The launcher states it.
///
/// The profile *is* the user's to set: an instance created for one profile may be pointed at
/// another, and the harness recognises the profile by name on every start.
