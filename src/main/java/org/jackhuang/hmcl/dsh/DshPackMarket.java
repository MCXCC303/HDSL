/// The community's modpack market, as published.
///
/// The ecosystem is **not centralised**: an author only uploads to GitHub, tags the repository
/// `dsh-pack`, and attaches the archive to a release. A collector walks that tag once a day and
/// writes what it finds into one index, which is what this reads. So there is no submission step
/// anywhere in this file — the index is a directory of things that already exist, and the most this
/// can do with it is list them and fetch them.
///
/// Two documents, and the split matters:
///
/// - **the index** (`index.json`) — one line per pack version, with the three things needed to fetch
///   it: `downloadUrl`, `sha256`, and `size`. That is all a list needs, and it is all this class
///   reads.
/// - **the manifest** (`packs/<id>/manifest.json`) — the pack's full description, fetched one pack at
///   a time when somebody opens it. The index deliberately does **not** carry it: three packs would
///   not matter, three thousand would.
///
/// The index is on GitHub Pages, which this launcher may not be able to reach — the same network that
/// cannot reach it cannot reach the plugin catalogue either, and that one already falls back to a
/// copy on disk. The same fallback is here, for the same reason: a launcher that cannot reach the
/// market can still show what it showed yesterday.
