/// What the launcher tells plugins about the account an instance is running as.
///
/// The harness already has the entry point this uses, and it is the harness's own rather than
/// this launcher's invention: {@code @deepseek-ai/dsh-launch-environment} freezes a snapshot of
/// the launch environment in three layers with a fixed trust order — the environment this
/// process inherited, the invoking directory's {@code .env}, and the harness home's
/// {@code .env} — and any plugin can resolve a value out of it and ask which layer supplied it:
///
/// {@snippet :
/// launchEnvironmentOf(ctx).getFrom("HDSL_ACCOUNT_NAME", ["process", "user-env"])?.value
/// }
///
/// So a plugin that wants to show who this instance is running as does not need the launcher to
/// know anything about that plugin: it reads a name the launcher publishes, in a layer the
/// harness already ranks. Two layers here, for two different lifetimes:
///
/// - the **process environment** of the launch, which is the layer the harness trusts most and
///   which exists exactly as long as the run does;
/// - the **harness home's {@code .env}**, which outlives the launch, so a person who starts the
///   harness by hand — or from the terminal this launcher opens on an instance — gets the same
///   answers the launcher's own launches give.
///
/// Two rules make this safe to publish, and both come from the harness rather than from taste:
///
/// - **No credentials.** The key stays in the process environment alone, under its own name, and
///   never reaches a file. The contract is metadata for showing and routing, nothing else.
/// - **No {@code DSH_} names.** The bootstrap refuses that prefix, and every other bootstrap
///   name, from any discovered {@code .env} — and refuses it by throwing, so one careless line
///   here would stop the harness from starting at all. Everything this writes is
///   {@code HDSL_}, which the harness leaves alone.
