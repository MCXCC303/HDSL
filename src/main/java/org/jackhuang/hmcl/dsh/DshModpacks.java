/// A description of an instance that is enough to build it again elsewhere.
///
/// The original's modpack is a manifest plus the files that go with it: what to
/// download, and what to copy in afterwards. This is that for an instance of
/// DeepSeek Harness, and it is deliberately *configuration only* — the version of
/// the harness, the boot library it is paired with, the profile's plugin list in
/// its load order, and the profile's own patch layer. Nothing installed travels:
/// an installed tree is a few hundred megabytes of packages resolved for one
/// machine's platform and collected by one machine's package-manager store, and a
/// released Desktop build only gets away with shipping one because it vendors
/// integrity-recorded archives and filters them per platform. What is reproducible
/// is the *recipe*, and the recipe is a few kilobytes.
///
/// The plugin list is the part worth being careful about, because the profile's
/// bundle list is the order its patch layers are applied in: a later bundle
/// overrides an earlier one's rows, and a patch replaces a row's whole
/// configuration rather than merging into it. So the order is recorded exactly as
/// it is, and restored by writing the profile manifest and then letting pnpm
/// resolve the whole list in one run — installing bundles one at a time would
/// append each at the end and lose the order the pack was made with.
///
/// What a plugin was *configured* with travels too: the harness keeps one section per plugin in
/// `settings.yaml`, and that file is most of what "the same environment" means for a plugin — a
/// sidebar's custom CSS, a market's preferences. The sections travel, the values that look like
/// credentials do not, and a section is merged key by key into the next home so that a value the pack
/// left out cannot delete the one that machine already had. See [DshPluginSettings].
///
/// A plugin the instance installed from a file is the one thing that cannot be named and fetched, so
/// it travels as its own files and is put back into the next instance's plugin directory. That is the
/// exception to *configuration only*, and it is a deliberate one: a pack that named a path from the
/// machine it was made on would describe an installation nobody can make. A local plugin that the
/// registry *does* publish at the version the instance has is not carried — the pack names
/// `name@version` instead, which installs the same thing from the registry.
///
/// Credentials never travel. The harness keeps provider keys in `.credentials.yaml`
/// beside the sessions, and this reads nothing from there; the profile's patch
/// layer is included because it is composition, and the launcher says so when it
/// writes a pack, since a patch is a file a person can put anything into.
