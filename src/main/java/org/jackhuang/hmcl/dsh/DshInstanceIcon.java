/// The icon shown for a launcher instance.
///
/// The mechanism and the set are HMCL's: an instance carries an icon selection,
/// the list and the sidebar show it, and the chooser offers the same images the
/// original does. The mod-loader artwork is kept for that parity — a launcher
/// that offers fewer choices than the one it is modelled on reads as a
/// limitation rather than a decision.
///
/// The DeepSeek Harness marks lead the set. They were supplied as SVG and are
/// kept as PNG, which is what every other icon here is and what the image
/// container reads: HMCL's own icons are inline path data in an enum, and
/// introducing a second mechanism for three images would not pay for itself.
///
/// Each icon is a 32-pixel image with a 64-pixel `@2x` beside it, matching the
/// set it joins. Rendering the wrong one is not obvious in a still: the
/// container scales what it is given, so a mis-sized asset looks merely soft.
