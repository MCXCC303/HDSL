/// The plugin settings a pack carries, and the ones it must not.
///
/// The harness keeps user settings in one file, `settings.yaml`, as one section per plugin: a
/// sidebar's custom CSS, a market's preferences, a workstation's switches. That file is most of what
/// "the same environment" means for a plugin — a pack that restored the plugin but not its settings
/// would hand somebody the same program configured differently — so a pack carries the sections and
/// merges them into the next home on install, leaving every section it does not carry untouched.
///
/// Three kinds of section are **not** carried, and the reasons differ:
///
/// - `agent-default-model` and `llm-pi-ai` belong to the launcher's own account plumbing. They name
///   provider routes this launcher built for *this* machine's account, and a route is not a setting
///   that travels: on the next machine it names a provider that is not there.
/// - `ui-onboarding` is the harness's record that somebody has been shown the tour, which a new
///   instance should be shown.
/// - Anything that looks like a credential is removed from the sections that do travel. A key in a
///   pack is a key handed to whoever opens the pack. The harness's own design keeps keys in
///   `.credentials.yaml`, which no pack reads — but a plugin can put a literal key in its own
///   settings, and `remote-web-ui` in fact keeps a tunnel token in one. A value that names a
///   credential rather than being one — `apiKeyCredentialRef: PUBCHEM_API_KEY` — is kept: that is the
///   portable half, and the key it names stays where it belongs.
///
/// The file is edited as lines rather than parsed as YAML, the way [DshDefaultModel] edits its own
/// section: everything outside the sections a pack carries has to come back unchanged, including
/// comments, ordering, and anything a harness version writes that this launcher does not know about.
