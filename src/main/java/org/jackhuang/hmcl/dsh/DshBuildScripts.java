/// Decides whether a plugin's install scripts may run.
///
/// A package can carry a script that runs when it is installed, and a package manager
/// will not run one unless it is told to: that is the whole point of the setting, since
/// the script runs with the user's own rights and nobody has read it. When pnpm meets a
/// package it will not build, it writes the package into the profile's
/// `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with a placeholder instead of an answer:
///
/// ```yaml
/// allowBuilds:
///   node-pty: set this to true or false
/// ```
///
/// and refuses the installation until somebody answers. That refusal is the usual case rather than an
/// edge one: `strict-dep-builds` is true in pnpm 11's own defaults, so an undecided build makes it
/// exit non-zero — after writing the placeholder, which is what this reads.
///
/// What it writes as the entry's key is the package's **id** rather than always its name. A package
/// from the registry is `node-pty`; one installed from a file is
/// `build-script-probe@file:../pkg/build-script-probe-1.0.0.tgz`, because the version a `file:`
/// dependency resolves to is not a version. The id therefore carries a colon of its own, and the key
/// read here is the whole of it — kept whole, and written back whole.
///
/// Answering is a decision about running code, so this launcher does not answer on its own: it reads
/// what is waiting so the interface can say so, and writes an answer when a person gives one. That is
/// what makes it a setting rather than a behaviour — one that can be on for an instance
/// whose plugins are known and off for one whose plugins are not.
