/// catalogue the marketplace plugin reads is the community's answer, and it is a
/// plain JSON document on a plain HTTPS host, needing no key and answering with
/// `access-control-allow-origin: *`. Reading it here rather than driving the
/// marketplace keeps this launcher's plugin page working on an instance that has
/// no marketplace installed, which is the state every new instance starts in.
///
/// What the document carries per plugin is what the page shows: the npm name when
/// there is one, the repository, a category, localised descriptions, stars and a
/// download count. Just under half the entries have no npm name and can only be
/// installed from their repository, which is the slow path; the page says which
