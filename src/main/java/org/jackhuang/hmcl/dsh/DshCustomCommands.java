/// Runs the commands a person asked to run around an instance.
///
/// The original offers two: one before the game starts and one after it has ended, which is
/// how a launcher is made to fit somebody's own workflow — starting a companion process,
/// syncing a directory, telling something that a session began or ended. They belong here
/// for the same reason: an instance of DeepSeek Harness is a long-running thing that people
/// wrap in their own tooling.
///
/// A command that fails before the launch stops the launch: it was asked to run first, and
/// starting anyway would be ignoring what it was for. One that fails afterwards is reported
/// and nothing more can be done about it. Commands run in the instance's own working
/// directory, and the environment the instance runs with is the environment they see, so a
/// command sees what the instance would.
