/// Port selection for the browser surface.

/// probing for another one, so the launcher has to choose a free port itself.
/// It also has to keep choosing the *same* port for an instance: the browser
/// interface keys session state by origin, so reaching one history through two
/// ports lets two writers corrupt it.
///
/// The port is therefore settled once, when the instance is created, and written
/// into its manifest; every launch from then on asks for that same port. A port
/// that has since been taken is not worked around — moving the instance would
/// change the origin its state is keyed by — so the launch is refused and the
