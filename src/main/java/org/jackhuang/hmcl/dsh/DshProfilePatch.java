/// A profile's own patch layer, edited by lines.
///
/// A profile is composed from its bundles' layers and then from this file, and a plugin listed in
/// `dsh.profile.bundles` is applied **by that bundle's layer**. A pack that also inserts the same
/// plugin applies it twice, and a plugin that claims a route on the way up cannot be applied twice:
/// the profile then fails to load at all, with `webserver: duplicate exact route "…"` — which is how
/// one pack in the market came to be unlaunchable, and it is not obvious from the pack's contents,
/// because both halves look reasonable on their own.
///
/// So an insert that a bundle already applies is taken out. **An entry that carries configuration is
/// left alone and reported instead**: dropping it would drop the settings with it, and moving them
/// onto a row that targets the bundle's own id is a rewrite this does not do.
///
/// The other edit here is [`putProvider`][#putProvider], which is how an account's supplier reaches
/// the harness. Both are edits of a file that is the person's and that the harness itself rewrites,
/// so both are line edits: comments, `!!js` expressions, indentation and the file's own key order
/// all survive, and nothing outside the block being written is re-emitted.
