/// What a launch put into a home's own `settings.yaml`, and what was there before it.
///
/// An account's route is written into the profile's patch layer, and a patch says what the harness is
/// offered, not what it uses. The harness keeps its own answers in `settings.yaml` — the default
/// model it was told to use, and the route's own settings, which the harness writes when the person
/// edits that supplier — and those answers outlive the process. So a launch with a key leaves two
/// things behind in a file that is not the launcher's:
///
/// - `agent-default-model.provider` naming the route the launcher built, which the launcher wrote
///   itself for a supplier of the person's own;
/// - `llm-pi-ai.providers.<route>`, which the launcher puts there only so the harness's models page
///   has something to draw that route under, and which the harness then keeps — models whose route
///   may belong to an account that is no longer launched.
///
/// Left alone, the next launch with no account starts on that route instead of on the harness's own
/// supplier and its own question for a key. Which is why a launch **stashes** what it is about
/// to disturb, and why both the end of that launch and the beginning of the next one put it back.
///
/// **Putting back means restoring, not deleting.** Whatever was there before the launch is what
/// returns; content that was not there and is now is taken away. A value the person changed while
/// the harness was up is theirs and is left exactly as they left it — only the two shapes above are
/// touched at all, and the default model only while it still names the route this launch built.
