/// How much of the harness's dependency tree is held to the versions it declares.
///
/// The harness states its dependencies as ranges — `@deepseek-ai/cordis: ^4.0.2` — and a caret means
/// "4.0.2 **or anything newer that claims compatibility**". That is how a package the launcher never
/// chose arrives underneath it, and it has now broken a launch twice:
///
/// - `^0.1.6-alpha.1` resolved to alpha.2's libraries, which had dropped an export the launcher
///   imported;
/// - `@deepseek-ai/cordis-plugin-loader ^1.0.3` resolved to 1.0.4, whose `create()` returns before the
///   plugin it creates has registered its service — so the harness's own "load HMR, then use it"
///   step read `undefined` and the process exited with `requires the Cordis HMR service`.
///
/// Both times the version that worked was **the floor of the declared range**, which is the version
/// the author built against. So holding a dependency to its floor is not a guess: it is reading what
/// the package itself says it was written for.
