/// The paths a profile recorded for the plugins it installed from a file, and what
/// happens to them when the instance they belong to is renamed.
///
/// [DshLocalPlugins] copies a plugin into the instance before installing it, so that the
/// profile records a path inside the instance rather than wherever the file the user
/// picked happened to be. That is the right answer to *that* file moving — but the
/// instance moves as well: its directory is named after it, so renaming an instance
/// renames every path its profile recorded, and a copy is only ever as stable as the name
/// of the directory holding it.
///
/// A package manager resolves a local dependency through the path it was given, and
/// re-resolves the whole manifest on every later operation, so one stale path stops all of
/// them: adding the next plugin fails with a message about a missing tarball rather than
/// about the plugin, and taking one out fails the same way. Nothing about the installation
/// is wrong — only the name of the directory it is written down against. This is what
/// rewrites those records.
///
/// Two things make the rewrite smaller than it sounds:
///
/// - A local dependency is recorded twice. The *specification* is the path as given —
///   `file:/…/instances/<id>/plugins/x.tgz` — and that is the one that moves. The
///   *resolution* derived from it is written relative to the profile
///   (`file:../../../plugins/x.tgz`), so it survives the move on its own, and the virtual
///   store's directory names and every link under `node_modules` are built from that
///   relative form too.
/// - Only records naming the instance's own directory have to change. A plugin installed
///   from a file outside the instance, or from the registry, is left exactly as it is.
///
/// The rewrite is a substitution of the instance directory, and an occurrence counts only
/// where that directory is a whole path segment: renaming `a` must not touch a record that
/// names `a-b`, which is the rule [DshPluginBundle] applies to a package whose name is a
/// prefix of another's.
