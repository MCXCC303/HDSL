/// Moves a set of conversations between installations as one file.
///
/// A session is a directory holding a self-describing log, and the harness can
/// read one from any home it is put in — but only if three things hold, and all
/// three fail loudly rather than degrading: the directory's name must be the one
/// the log's own working directory identifies, the log's compression must match
/// what the home is configured for, and the log's first compressed frame must be
/// the header line by itself. A pack therefore copies the logs **byte for byte**
/// and never re-encodes them, keeps each session's directory name exactly as it
/// was, and records the working directory the sessions expect so that a pack
/// arriving somewhere else can say so before it is unpacked.
///
/// What a session needs besides its log is the attachment store: images and files
/// a conversation referred to are kept once per home, by content, and a session
/// whose attachments did not come along shows broken references. Those are copied
/// too — the ones the sessions name, when `zstd` is available to read the logs, or
/// the whole store when it is not, because a pack that silently loses images is
/// worse than a large one.
///
/// The projection cache is carried when it exists, although it is derived: it
/// holds the title a conversation is listed under, and a pack that arrives with
/// its titles is a pack that looks like what it came from. A target home refuses a
/// cache row it does not recognise rather than trusting it, so carrying one is
/// never a risk to the harness.
