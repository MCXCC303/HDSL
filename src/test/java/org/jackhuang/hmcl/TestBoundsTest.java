/// names are `junit.jupiter.execution.timeout.default` and its `…testable.method…`,

/// lists them. A setting nobody reads is worse than one nobody wrote, because the build file reads
/// as though the suite were bounded: a runner whose JavaFX toolkit never came up then held a build
/// for seventy-six minutes, and nothing in the log said the bound was missing. `assertNull` below is
